      "text": "Controversial pastor picked for Mansfield patrol program. By Vickie Welborn vwelborn@gannett.com Gannett March 24, 2009 MANSFIELD -- Mansfield Mayor Curtis McCoy wants to start a pastor on patrol program for the Mansfield Police Department and he's selected as his first candidate a self-described minister with a controversial past that includes time spent on the other side of the jail bars and troubles with the court system. The Rev. Roy Jones' most recent job was a convenience store clerk for which he had to obtain an alcoholic beverage control card so that he could sell alcoholic beverages. \"This is something I'm trying to do to make a better relationship between the police and the citizens,\" McCoy said of Jones' appointment. Unlike a similar program run by the Shreveport Police Department where ministers volunteer their time to ride on patrol with officers, Mansfield's Pastor on Patrol won't depend upon volunteers - or at this point anyone beyond Jones. Jones will be paid $9 an hour and work 24 hours a week. Asked why he didn't use Shreveport's program as a model, McCoy answered, \"I don't know what Shreveport does nor do I care to know what Shreveport does on that line. I only know what Mansfield is doing. \"McCoy would not comment on Jones' checkered past or his ability to remain unbiased in situations involving the police and citizenry since he is on the city's payroll. \"Based on his relationship in the community as far as knowing people, every time I go to church, I see him in a pulpit - I'm serious. I'm talking the honest God truth. & If he's not pastoring, he's there as a guest. But he knows the people in the community, and I think over the years he has proven himself to be an asset. \"Part-time employees can work six months before being presented to the Board of Aldermen. That's why Jones' official appointment was news to two Mansfield aldermen. Mitch Lewis and G.B. \"Sonny\" Hall were unaware of Jones' addition to the payroll. Lewis admitted that he was questioned over the weekend about Jones being seen last week in a patrol car with a police officer. \"I talked to Roy today (at the council meeting),\" Lewis said Monday night. \"He said yes he was doing it, but he didn't go into it. He said he was pastor on patrol. He said he was trying to get involved with the youth on the weekend and stuff like, which I think is good, but & I don't know. I think (McCoy's) intentions were good to try to set up that type of program. \"Added Hall: \"Most true pastors volunteer their time to do that. \"Jones, who was unseated in October 2007 from his first term on the DeSoto Parish Police Jury, is a close friend of McCoy's. He's aided the mayor in his two election campaigns and frequently accompanies him to functions. Jones did not return a message left on his answering machine Monday. Jones grabbed his own headlines while on the parish governing body. He was consistently involved in employee issues and public criticism of the road department supervisor, including filing complaints with the state attorney general's office that were later deemed unfounded. The Mansfield resident got his own hand slapped in 2005 when the district attorney ordered him to reimburse the parish $175 for gravel he directed onto a private driveway. He has prior arrests for trespassing, issuing worthless checks, failure to appear in court for criminal neglect of family and for failing to report to court on issuing worthless check charges. While he spent time in the DeSoto Detention Center for his arrests, Jones has avoided jail sentences by paying off the insufficient funds and the late child support payments. McCoy said he would later evaluate the program and add a \"white minister, too, because we want everyone to have someone they can talk to.\" Jones is black.",

      "text": "Senate DFL proposes cuts, $2 billion tax hike. However, the DFL plan does not include $2 billion in federal economic stimulus money that lawmakers still do not know just how they can use. The Thursday announcement brought the first public acknowledgment that Democrats would increase taxes to help balance the budget. Senate Tax Chairman Tom Bakk, DFL-Cook, said a \"lion's share\" of the $2 billion in new revenue would come from higher taxes on the rich, apparently via the income tax. The plan calls for cutting every segment of state government, for a total of $2.4 billion. While the Democratic leaders say they would take roughly equal amounts of new taxes and program cuts to balance the budget, they have yet to figure out where to put about $2 billion in federal economic stimulus money. Given that, Senate Majority Leader Larry Pogemiller, DFL-Minneapolis, said education cuts may end up being moderated once details of how the state can spend the federal money are unraveled. The state's $33 billion two-year budget would be $6.4 billion short without cuts, new taxes and federal money. Pawlenty figures the federal money into his budget and calls the deficit $4.6 billion. He is to announce changes to his budget in the next week to 10 days, taking into account recent economic changes. Pawlenty's spokesman said it was good that DFL leaders \"are finally publicly admitting they'd like to wallop the families and small businesses of Minnesota with massive tax increases.\" Brian McClung added that the cuts did not look at funding priorities. \"An off-the-shelf computer program could do these kinds of across-the-board cuts,\" McClung said. \"We would expect more from DFL legislators.\" Tom Dooher, president of Education Minnesota, was not happy with the Senate announcement. \"The proposed cuts are not in the best interest of Minnesota\u00e2 s school children,\" Dooher said. \"If enacted, they would seriously harm the quality of education the state takes pride in providing its students.\" House leaders plan to announce their budget outline soon, too. House and Senate committees will work out details of their budgets, then establish conference committees to work out differences between the two budgets. Pawlenty often has said he will veto tax increases, and Pogemiller has said that he believes Pawlenty. A third of the budget balancing act Democrats propose relies on higher taxes. Bakk said he would not allow his committee to consider adding the sales tax to clothing or services. Other taxes may be considered, he said, although higher taxes on the rich are his primary goal. Bakk also said he would like to freeze the amount of money the state gives local governments at a time when most policymakers are calling for a cut in local government aid. Pawlenty would cut the aid, which has raised city leaders' ire. Local governments will be forced to enact moderate property tax increases to deal with the DFL budget, Bakk said, but less than under Pawlenty's proposal. Republican senators said they were not consulted about the proposal. They called tax increases job killers, supporting Pawlenty's proposed business tax cuts instead. Pogemiller said drastic measures such as the 7 percent cut are needed because of the current recession. Most of the cuts, he added, will be to programs most affecting the state's needy residents. He called the economy \"as bad, potentially, as the 1930s.\" The Minnesota House unanimously voted to support freedom of the press Thursday, after a week of controversy. House Minority Leader Marty Seifert, R-Marshall \u00e2 \u201c joined by House Majority Leader Tony Sertich, DFL-Chisholm \u00e2 \u201c brought a motion to the floor voicing that support because proposed House rules would have restricted media work on the House floor and in committees. The proposed rules emerged a week ago today, creating a stir among the Capitol press corps. Then, Monday night, a committee page demanded to see credentials from a photographer \u00e2 \u201c two hours after a House leadership spokesman assured the media that no credentials would be needed to cover committee meetings. Seifert said recent events had \"a chilling effect\" on the press. \"I am very concerned about what has taken place recently.\" Sertich said the proposed rules will not be implemented. He said there has been confusion as the rules were being discussed and no changes should have been made by House staff members. Rep. Torrey Westrom, R-Elbow Lake, said the talk of stricter press rules is a sign of bigger problems with DFL leaders. \"I know the press isn't really happy with some of the moves going on around here,\" Westrom said. \"I'm glad they are speaking up.\" Numerous House members have told reporters that they also were not happy with the proposals.",

Complete Count Committees are appointed by the mayor or other elected official and include leaders from the business, education, faith, media, non-profit, ethnic and other communities. These volunteer committees work together on community events such as festivals, parades, meetings and other activities to keep Minnesota first in the nation in responding to the census. The 2010 census is critical for Minnesota, which is at risk of losing one of its eight seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, according to census officials. Census information is also the foundation of equal representation in the state Legislature and determines the allocation of more than $300 billion in federal funding for everything from education to transportation. The business community also uses census information for planning, marketing, labor force projections and more.
